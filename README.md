# ImgurToAO3
Convert the HTML markup of your [Imgur](https://imgur.com/) posts into a format that works on [Archive Of Our Own](https://archiveofourown.org/). 

Ideal for comics and other sequential, visual works.

‚úèÔ∏è The images must remain uploaded on Imgur, as AO3 does not provide image hosting. This simply allows them to be displayed as a work.

## Instructions

1. Sign in to imgur and edit the post you want to transfer.
   - You must be **editing a post *you own***, or else there aren't distinguishing markers between the posts's content and the other miscellaneous images on the page.
   - Getting them in the correct order of the imgur post itself is its own beast, and I can't really help you there üòÖ

1. ***Inspect*** the page and copy the markup
   - Since imgur loads in a bunch of stuff with javascript after the page initially loads, viewing the full page source normally doesn't work.

1. [Optional] If you have wrapping images that will be reused across several episodes, coming before and after the dynamic content (like a title card or end credit screen), paste their URLs into text files, each URL on a new line.
